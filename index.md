UAVCAN is a lightweight protocol designed for reliable communication in aerospace and robotic applications via [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus).

## Key features

- Very **low data overhead** - suitable for high frequency distributed control loops.
- **Democratic network** - no single point of failure.
- Supports **network-wide time synchronization** with microsecond precision.
- Allows to efficiently exchange long datagrams.
- **Publish/subscribe** or **request/response** exchange semantics.
- Doubly-redundant or triply-redundant CAN bus support.
- Lightweight, easy to implement protocol.
- Can be used in deeply embedded systems (the reference implementation runs on a **32K ROM**, **8K RAM** MCU).
- The specification and the reference implementation are open and free to use ([MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).
