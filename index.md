# UAVCAN v0 (legacy)

This website is dedicated to the experimental version of the protocol, otherwise known as *UAVCAN v0*.
This version is now obsolete and should not be used in new designs.
Existing deployments will benefit from our commitment to provide long-term support and maintenance of
UAVCAN v0-based systems.

To learn about the stable version of the protocol, proceed to the **[main website](https://uavcan.org/)**,
and read the [UAVCAN v1 crash course](https://forum.uavcan.org/t/uavcan-v1-crash-course/778).
