**UAVCAN is an open lightweight protocol designed for reliable communication in aerospace and robotic
applications over robust vehicular networks such as CAN bus.**

This website is dedicated to the experimental version of the protocol, otherwise known as *UAVCAN v0*.
There is work underway to release the first version of the protocol specification, based on the learnings from v0,
and a set of robust reference implementations by 2020 Q1.
The first version is known as *UAVCAN v1.0*.

All new designs should use UAVCAN v1.0.
Existing deployments will benefit from our commitment to provide long-term support and maintenance of
UAVCAN v0-based systems.

To learn more about the upcoming stable release UAVCAN v1.0,
please visit the new website at [new.uavcan.org](https://new.uavcan.org/), and read the article
["UAVCAN: a highly dependable publish-subscribe protocol for real-time intravehicular networking"](https://forum.uavcan.org/t/557).
