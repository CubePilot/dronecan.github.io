The higher level concepts of UAVCAN are described in this section.

## Node initialization

UAVCAN does not require that nodes undergo any specific initialization upon connecting to the bus.
Therefore, a node is free to begin functioning immediately once it is powered up.
The only application-level function that every UAVCAN node must support is the periodic proadcasting of the
node status message, which is documented next.

## Node status reporting

Every UAVCAN node must report its status and presence by means of broadcasting a message of type
`uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus`.
This is the only data structure that UAVCAN nodes are required to support.
All other application-level functions are considered optional.

It should be noted that the ID of this message, when represented in binary, contains long sequence
of alternating 0 and 1, which facilitates automatic CAN bus bit rate detection.

The definition of the message is provided below.

## Time synchronization

UAVCAN supports network-wide precise time synchronization with a resolution of up to 1 CAN bus bit period
(i.e., 1 microsecond for 1 Mbps CAN bit rate), assuming that CAN frame timestamping is supported by the hardware.
The algorithm can also function in the absence of hardware support for timestamping, although its performance will be
degraded.

The time synchronization approach is based on the work
"Implementing a Distributed High-Resolution Real-Time Clock using the CAN-Bus" (M. Gergeleit and H. Streich).
The general idea of the algorithm is to have one or more nodes that periodically broadcast a message of type
`uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync` (definition is provided below) containing the exact timestamp of the previous
transmission of this message.
A node that performs a periodic broadcast of this message is referred to as a *time synchronization master*,
whereas a node that synchronizes its time with the master is referred to as a *time synchronization slave*.

Note that this algorithm only allows to precisely estimate the phase difference between the given slave and
the master it is synchronized with.
UAVCAN does not define the algorithm for clock speed/phase adjustment, which is entirely implementation defined.

The following constants are defined for the time synchronization algorithm:

* *T<sub>max</sub>* - maximum broadcast interval for a given master.
* *T<sub>min</sub>* - minimum broadcast interval for a given master.
* *T<sub>timeout</sub>* - if the master was not broadcasting the time synchronization message for this amount of time,
all slaves shall switch to the next active master with the highest priority.

The network may accommodate more than one time synchronization master working at the same time.
In this case, only the master with the lowest node ID should be active;
other masters should become passive by means of stopping broadcasting time synchronization messages,
and they must synchronize with the active master instead.
If the currently active master was not broadcasting time synchronization messages for the duration of
*T<sub>timeout</sub>*, the next master with the highest priority becomes active instead,
and all slaves will synchronize with it.
When a higher priority master appears in the network, all other lower-priority masters should become passive,
and all slaves will synchronize with the new master immediately.

The message `uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync` contains the exact timestamp of the previous transmission of this message.
If the previous message was not yet transmitted,
or if it was transmitted more than *T<sub>max</sub>* time units ago, the field must be set to zero.

### Master

The following pseudocode describes the logic of a time synchronization master.

```c++
// State variables:
transfer_id := 0;
previous_tx_timestamp[NUM_IFACES];

// This function broadcasts a message with a specified Transfer ID using only one iface:
function broadcastMessage(transfer_id, iface_index, msg);

function messageTxTimestampCallback(iface_index, tx_timestamp)
{
    previous_tx_timestamp[iface_index] := tx_timestamp;
}

// Publishes the message of type uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync to each available interface
function broadcastTimeSync()
{
    // TODO: make sure the publishing interval is not lower than minimum publication period

    message := uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync();

    for (i := 0; i < NUM_IFACES; i++)
    {
        message.previous_transmission_timestamp_usec := previous_tx_timestamp[i];
        previous_tx_timestamp[i] := 0;
        broadcastMessage(transfer_id, i, message);
    }

    transfer_id++; // Overflow must be handled correctly
}
```

### Slave

The following pseudocode describes the logic of a time synchronization slave.

```c++
// State variables:
previous_rx_timestamp := 0;               // This time is being synchronized
previous_rx_monotonic_timestamp := 0;     // This is the monotonic time (doesn't jump or change rate)
previous_transfer_id := 0;
state := STATE_UPDATE;       // STATE_UPDATE, STATE_ADJUST
master_node_id := -1;        // Invalid value
iface_index := -1;           // Invalid value

// This function performs local clock adjustment:
function adjustLocalTime(phase_error);

function adjust(message)
{
    // Clock adjustment will be performed every second message
    local_time_phase_error := previous_rx_timestamp - msg.previous_transmission_timestamp_usec;
    adjustLocalTime(local_time_phase_error);
    state := STATE_UPDATE;
}

function update(message)
{
    // Message is assumed to have two timestamps:
    //   Real - sampled from the clock that is being synchronized
    //   Monotonic - clock that never jumps and never changes rate
    previous_rx_timestamp := message.rx_timestamp;
    previous_rx_monotonic_timestamp := message.rx_monotonic_timestamp;
    master_node_id := message.source_node_id;
    iface_index := message.iface_index;
    previous_transfer_id := message.transfer_id;
    state := STATE_ADJUST;
}

// Accepts the message of type uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync (please refer to the DSDL definition)
function handleReceivedTimeSyncMessage(message)
{
    time_since_previous_msg := message.monotonic_timestamp - previous_rx_monotonic_timestamp;

    // Resolving the state flags:
    needs_init := (master_node_id < 0) or (iface_index < 0);
    switch_master := message.source_node_id < master_node_id;
    publisher_timed_out := time_since_previous_msg > PUBLISHER_TIMEOUT;

    if (needs_init or switch_master or publisher_timed_out)
    {
        update(message);
    }
    else if ((message.iface_index == iface_index) && (message.source_node_id == master_node_id))
    {
        // Revert the state to STATE_UPDATE if needed
        if (state == STATE_ADJUST)
        {
            msg_invalid := message.previous_transmission_timestamp_usec == 0;
            wrong_tid := message.transfer_id != (previous_transfer_id + 1);    // Overflow must be handled correctly
            wrong_timing := time_since_previous_msg > MAX_PUBLICATION_PERIOD;
            if (msg_invalid or wrong_tid or wrong_timing)
            {
                state := STATE_UPDATE;
            }
        }
        // Handle the current state
        if (state == STATE_ADJUST)
        {
            adjust(message);
        }
        else
        {
            update(message);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        ; // Ignore this message
    }
}
```
