The higher level concepts of UAVCAN are described in this section.

## Node initialization

UAVCAN does not require that nodes undergo any specific initialization upon connecting to the bus.
Therefore, a node is free to begin functioning immediately once it is powered up.
The only application-level function that every UAVCAN node must support is the periodic proadcasting of the
node status message, which is documented next.

## Node status reporting

Every UAVCAN node must report its status and presence by means of broadcasting a message of type
`uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus`.
This is the only data structure that UAVCAN nodes are required to support.
All other application-level functions are considered optional.

It should be noted that the ID of this message, when represented in binary, contains long sequence
of alternating 0 and 1, which facilitates automatic CAN bus bit rate detection.

The definition of the message is provided below.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus' %}

## Node discovery

UAVCAN provides means of obtaining the list of all nodes present in the network
as well as detailed information about each node.

List of all nodes that are connected to the bus can be created and maintained
by means of listening for node status messages `uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus`.

Extended information about each node can be requested using the services documented below.
Note that **it is highly recommended to support the service `uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo` in every node**,
as it is vital for discovery and identification purposes.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo' %}

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.GetDataTypeInfo' %}

## Time synchronization

UAVCAN supports network-wide precise time synchronization with a resolution of up to 1 CAN bus bit period
(i.e., 1 microsecond for 1 Mbps CAN bit rate), assuming that CAN frame timestamping is supported by the hardware.
The algorithm can also function in the absence of hardware support for timestamping, although its performance will be
degraded.

The time synchronization approach is based on the work
"Implementing a Distributed High-Resolution Real-Time Clock using the CAN-Bus" (M. Gergeleit and H. Streich).
The general idea of the algorithm is to have one or more nodes that periodically broadcast a message of type
`uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync` (definition is provided below) containing the exact timestamp of the previous
transmission of this message.
A node that performs a periodic broadcast of this message is referred to as a *time synchronization master*,
whereas a node that synchronizes its time with the master is referred to as a *time synchronization slave*.

Note that this algorithm only allows to precisely estimate the phase difference between the given slave and
the master it is synchronized with.
UAVCAN does not define the algorithm for clock speed/phase adjustment, which is entirely implementation defined.

The following constants are defined for the time synchronization algorithm:

* *T<sub>max</sub>* - maximum broadcast interval for a given master.
* *T<sub>min</sub>* - minimum broadcast interval for a given master.
* *T<sub>timeout</sub>* - if the master was not broadcasting the time synchronization message for this amount of time,
all slaves shall switch to the next active master with the highest priority.

The network may accommodate more than one time synchronization master working at the same time.
In this case, only the master with the lowest node ID should be active;
other masters should become passive by means of stopping broadcasting time synchronization messages,
and they must synchronize with the active master instead.
If the currently active master was not broadcasting time synchronization messages for the duration of
*T<sub>timeout</sub>*, the next master with the highest priority becomes active instead,
and all slaves will synchronize with it.
When a higher priority master appears in the network, all other lower-priority masters should become passive,
and all slaves will synchronize with the new master immediately.

The message `uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync` contains the exact timestamp of the previous transmission of this message.
If the previous message was not yet transmitted,
or if it was transmitted more than *T<sub>max</sub>* time units ago, the field must be set to zero.

### Master

The following pseudocode describes the logic of a time synchronization master.

```c++
// State variables:
transfer_id := 0;
previous_tx_timestamp[NUM_IFACES];

// This function broadcasts a message with a specified Transfer ID using only one iface:
function broadcastMessage(transfer_id, iface_index, msg);

function messageTxTimestampCallback(iface_index, tx_timestamp)
{
    previous_tx_timestamp[iface_index] := tx_timestamp;
}

// Publishes the message of type uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync to each available interface
function broadcastTimeSync()
{
    // TODO: make sure the publishing interval is not lower than minimum publication period

    message := uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync();

    for (i := 0; i < NUM_IFACES; i++)
    {
        message.previous_transmission_timestamp_usec := previous_tx_timestamp[i];
        previous_tx_timestamp[i] := 0;
        broadcastMessage(transfer_id, i, message);
    }

    transfer_id++; // Overflow must be handled correctly
}
```

### Slave

The following pseudocode describes the logic of a time synchronization slave.

```c++
// State variables:
previous_rx_timestamp := 0;               // This time is being synchronized
previous_rx_monotonic_timestamp := 0;     // This is the monotonic time (doesn't jump or change rate)
previous_transfer_id := 0;
state := STATE_UPDATE;       // STATE_UPDATE, STATE_ADJUST
master_node_id := -1;        // Invalid value
iface_index := -1;           // Invalid value

// This function performs local clock adjustment:
function adjustLocalTime(phase_error);

function adjust(message)
{
    // Clock adjustment will be performed every second message
    local_time_phase_error := previous_rx_timestamp - msg.previous_transmission_timestamp_usec;
    adjustLocalTime(local_time_phase_error);
    state := STATE_UPDATE;
}

function update(message)
{
    // Message is assumed to have two timestamps:
    //   Real - sampled from the clock that is being synchronized
    //   Monotonic - clock that never jumps and never changes rate
    previous_rx_timestamp := message.rx_timestamp;
    previous_rx_monotonic_timestamp := message.rx_monotonic_timestamp;
    master_node_id := message.source_node_id;
    iface_index := message.iface_index;
    previous_transfer_id := message.transfer_id;
    state := STATE_ADJUST;
}

// Accepts the message of type uavcan.protocol.GlobalTimeSync (please refer to the DSDL definition)
function handleReceivedTimeSyncMessage(message)
{
    time_since_previous_msg := message.monotonic_timestamp - previous_rx_monotonic_timestamp;

    // Resolving the state flags:
    needs_init := (master_node_id < 0) or (iface_index < 0);
    switch_master := message.source_node_id < master_node_id;
    publisher_timed_out := time_since_previous_msg > PUBLISHER_TIMEOUT;

    if (needs_init or switch_master or publisher_timed_out)
    {
        update(message);
    }
    else if ((message.iface_index == iface_index) && (message.source_node_id == master_node_id))
    {
        // Revert the state to STATE_UPDATE if needed
        if (state == STATE_ADJUST)
        {
            msg_invalid := message.previous_transmission_timestamp_usec == 0;
            wrong_tid := message.transfer_id != (previous_transfer_id + 1);    // Overflow must be handled correctly
            wrong_timing := time_since_previous_msg > MAX_PUBLICATION_PERIOD;
            if (msg_invalid or wrong_tid or wrong_timing)
            {
                state := STATE_UPDATE;
            }
        }
        // Handle the current state
        if (state == STATE_ADJUST)
        {
            adjust(message);
        }
        else
        {
            update(message);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        ; // Ignore this message
    }
}
```

## Node configuration

UAVCAN defines standard services for retrieving/updating remote node configuration parameters.
Support for these services is not mandatory but is highly recommended. These services are as follows:

* `uavcan.protocol.param.GetSet` - gets or sets a single configuration parameter value, either by name or by index.
* `uavcan.protocol.param.ExecuteOpcode` - allows to control the node configuration,
including saving the configuration to non-volatile memory, or resetting the configuration to defaults.
* `uavcan.protocol.RestartNode` - restarts a node remotely.
Some nodes may require a restart before the new configuration parameters can be applied.

In some cases, node configuration is more complex than can be conveniently accessed via these services.
If this is the case, the node is recommended to support configuration through configuration files accessible via
the standard file transfer services (documented in this section).

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.param.' %}

### Standard configuration parameters

There are some configuration parameters that are common for most UAVCAN nodes.
Examples of such common parameters include message publication frequencies, non-default data type ID settings,
local node ID, etc.
UAVCAN specification improves compatibility by means of providing the following naming
conventions for UAVCAN-related configuration parameters.
Following these conventions is highly encouraged, but not mandatory.
If the designer chose to not follow the conventions, it is highly recommended to consider at least exposing
compatible interface through the standard configuration services documented above.

As can be seen below, all standard UAVCAN-related parameters share the same prefix `uavcan.`.

#### Data type ID

Parameter name: `uavcan.dtid-X`, where **X** stands for the full data type name, e.g.
`uavcan.dtid-uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus`.

This parameter configures the data type ID value for a given data type.

#### Message publication period

Parameter name: `uavcan.pubp-X`, where **X** stands for the full data type name; e.g.
`uavcan.pubp-uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus`.

This parameter configures the publication period for a given data type, in integer number of microseconds.
Zero value means that publication should be disabled.

#### Transfer priority

Parameter name: `uavcan.prio-X`, where **X** stands for the full data type name, e.g.
`uavcan.prio-uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus`.

This parameter configures the transport priority level that will be used when publishing messages or
calling services of a given data type.

#### Node ID

Parameter name: `uavcan.node_id`.

This parameter configures ID of the local node.
Zero means that the node ID is unconfigured, which may prompt the node to resort to dynamic node ID
allocation after startup.

#### CAN bus bit rate

Parameter name: `uavcan.bit_rate`.

This parameter configures CAN bus bitrate.
Please refer to the hardware design recommendations for recommended values and other details.

#### Instance ID

Parameter name: `uavcan.id-X-Y`, where **X** is namespace name; **Y** is ID field name.

Some UAVCAN messages (standard and possibly vendor-specific ones) use special fields that identify the instance of
a certain function - *ID fields*.
For example, messages related to actuator control use fields named `actuator_id`,
some sensor messages use fields named `sensor_id`, etc.
In order to improve compatibility, the specification offers a naming convention for parameters that define the
values used in ID fields.

Given messages located in the namespace **X** that share an ID field named **Y**,
corresponding parameter name would be `uavcan.id-X-Y`.
For example, parameter for the field `esc_index` that is used in message `uavcan.equipment.esc.Status`
and that defines the array index in `uavcan.equipment.esc.RawCommand`, will be named as follows:

    uavcan.id-uavcan.equipment.esc-esc_index

In case if an ID field is shared across different namespaces,
then the most common outer shared namespace should be used as **X**.
This is not the case for any of the standard messages, so an example cannot be provided.

In case if an ID field is used in the standard namespace (`uavcan.*`) and in some vendor-specific namespaces
at the same time, the prefix should be used as though the ID field was used only in the standard namespace.

## File transfer

File transfer is a very generic feature of UAVCAN, that allows to access file system on remote nodes.
Entire feature is based upon a set of UAVCAN services that are listed below.

### Firmware update

In terms of UAVCAN, firmware update is a special case of file transfer.
The process of firmware update includes two or three nodes:

* The node that initiates the process of firmware update, or *updater*.
* The node that provides access to the firmware file, or *file server*.
In most cases, the updater will be serving as a file server, therefore in most cases only two nodes are involved.
* The node that is being updated, or *updatee*.

The process can be described as follows:

1. The updater decides that a certain node should be updated. The latter node will be referred to as *updatee*.
2. The updater invokes the service `uavcan.protocol.file.BeginFirmwareUpdate` on the updatee.
The information about the location of the firmware file will be passed to the updatee via the service request.
3. If the updatee choses to accept the update request, it performs initialization procedures as required by
implementation (e.g., rebooting into the bootloader, etc).
4. The updatee receives new firmware file from the file server using information received via the service request above.
5. The updatee completes the update and restarts.

Typically, the updatee will also resort to the dynamic node ID allocation process,
which is documented in this section.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.file.' %}

## Debug features

The following messages are designed to facilitate debugging and to provide means of reporting events in
a human-readable representation.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.debug.' %}

## Command shell access

The following service allows to execute arbitrary commands on a remote node by means of direct access to its
internal command shell.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.AccessCommandShell' %}

## Panic mode

Panic message allows to quickly shut down the system in an event of emergency.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.Panic' %}

## Dynamic node ID allocation

In order to be able to operate in a UAVCAN network, a node must have a node ID that is unique within the network.
Typically, a valid node ID can be configured manually for each node; however, in certain use cases the manual
approach is either undesirable or impossible, therefore UAVCAN defines a high-level feature of dynamic node ID
allocation, that allows nodes to obtain a node ID value automatically upon connection to the network.

The feature of dynamic node ID allocation combined with automatic CAN bus bit rate detection allows to easily
implement nodes that can join any UAVCAN network without any manual configuration.
Nodes that are capable of joining a UAVCAN network without prior manual configuration
are referred to as *plug-and-play nodes*.

The process of dynamic node ID allocation always involves two types of nodes: *allocators*, which serve
allocation requests; and *allocatees*, which request dynamic node ID from allocators.
A UAVCAN network may implement the following configurations of allocators:

* Zero allocators, in which case the feature of dynamic node ID allocation will not be available.
* One allocator, in which case the feature of dynamic node ID allocation will become unavailable if the allocator fails.
This is a very simple configuration, in which case the role of an allocator can be performed even by a very
resource-constrained system, e.g. a low-end microcontroller.
* Three allocators, in which case the allocators will be using a replicated state via a distributed consensus
algorithm. In this configuration, the network can tolerate loss of one allocator and continue to serve allocation
requests. This configuration requires the allocators to maintain large data structures for the purposes of the
distributed consensus algorithm, which may require a slightly more sophisticated computational platform,
e.g. a high-end microcontroller.
* Five allocators, which is as above, with only difference in that the network may tolerate the loss of two
allocators and still continue to serve allocation requests.

In order to get a dynamic node ID, each allocatee must have a globally unique 128-bit integer identifier,
known as *unique ID*.
During dynamic allocation, the allocatee communicates its unique ID to the allocator (or allocators),
which then use it to produce an appropriate allocation response.
Unique ID values are kept by allocators in *allocation tables* -
data structures that contain mappings between unique ID and corresponding node ID values.
Allocation tables are write-only data structures that can only grow,
which implies that once a new allocator has requested a node ID,
its unique ID will be recorded into the allocation table,
and all subsequent allocation requests from the same allocatee will be served with the same node ID value.

In configurations with redundant allocators, every allocator maintains a replica of the same allocation table,
which implies that an UAVCAN network cannot contain more than one allocation table, regardless of the number of
allocators employed.
As has been mentioned above, the allocation table is write-only data structure that can only grow,
although it is still possible to wipe the allocation table completely, forcing the allocators to
forget known nodes and perform all following allocations anew.

In the context of this shapter, nodes that are using dynamic node ID will be referred to as *dynamic nodes*, and
nodes that are using manually-configured node ID will be referred to as *static nodes*.
It is assumed that in most cases, allocators will be static nodes themselves (since there's no other authority on the
network that can grant dynamic node ID, allocators will not be able to dynamically allocate themselves).
Excepting allocators, it is not recommended to mix dynamic and static nodes on the same network; i.e.,
normally, a UAVCAN network should contain either all static nodes, or all dynamic nodes (except allocators).
In case if this recommendation cannot be followed,
the following rules of safe co-existence of dynamic nodes with static nodes must be considered:

1. It is safe to connect dynamic nodes to the bus at any time.
2. A static node can be connected to the bus if the allocator (allocators) is (are) already aware of them,
i.e. these static nodes are already in the allocation table.
3. A new static node (i.e. a node that does not meet the above condition) can be connected to the bus only if:
  1. New dynamic allocations are not happening at the moment.
  2. The allocators are capable of serving new allocations.

As can be inferred from the above, the process of dynamic node ID allocation involves up to two types of
communications:

* *Allocatee-allocator* - this communication is used when an allocatee requests a dynamic node ID from the allocator
(allocators), and when the allocator (allocators) transmits a response back to the allocatee.
This communication is invariant to the allocator configuration used, i.e., the allocatees are not aware of
how many allocators are available on the network and how they are configured.
* *Allocator-allocator* - this communication is used by allocators for the purpose of maintenance of the
replicated allocation table and for other needs of the distributed consensus algorithm. Allocatees are completely
isolated and unaware of these exchanges. This communication is not applicable for the single-allocator configuration.

### Allocatee-allocator exchanges

Allocatee-allocator exchanges are performed using only one message type -
`uavcan.protocol.dynamic_node_id.Allocation`.
Allocators use it with regular message broadcast transfers; allocatees use it with anonymous message transfers.
The specification and usage info for this data type is provided below.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.dynamic_node_id.Allocation' header_prefix='####' %}

### Allocator-allocator exchanges

Replication of the allocation table is based on the Raft consenus algorithm, as published in
"In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)" (Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout).

The exchanges are based on message and service types defined in the namespace
`uavcan.protocol.dynamic_node_id.server`. Their definitions are provided below.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.dynamic_node_id.server' header_prefix='####' %}
