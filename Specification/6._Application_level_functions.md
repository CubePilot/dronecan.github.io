The higher level concepts of UAVCAN are described in this section.

## Node initialization

UAVCAN does not require that nodes undergo any specific initialization upon connecting to the bus.
Therefore, a node is free to begin functioning immediately once it is powered up.
The only application-level function that every UAVCAN node must support is the periodic proadcasting of the
node status message, which is documented next.

## Node status reporting

Every UAVCAN node must report its status and presence by means of broadcasting a message of type
`uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus`.
This is the only data structure that UAVCAN nodes are required to support.
All other application-level functions are considered optional.

It should be noted that the ID of this message, when represented in binary, contains long sequence
of alternating 0 and 1, which facilitates automatic CAN bus bit rate detection.

The definition of the message is provided below.

{% include dsdl.md prefix='uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus' %}
