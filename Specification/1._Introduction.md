# Introduction

This section covers basic concepts that govern development and maintenance of the specification.
The actual specification is contained in the following sections.

## Specification update and approval process

UAVCAN development team is charged with advancing the specification based on the input from adopters
gathered via the [mailing list](/Contact.html), where everyone can contribute to the discussion.

The set of standard DSDL definitions is one of the cornerstone concepts of the specification.
Within the same major version, it can be extended only in the following ways:

* A new data type can be added, possibly with default data type ID, as long as the default data type ID doesn't
conflict with one of the existing data types.
* An existing data type can be modified, as long as the modification doesn't break backward compatibility.
* An existing data type can be declared deprecated. Once declared deprecated, the data type will be maintained
for at least two more years before its default data type ID can be reused for an incompatible data type.
Deprecation will be announced via the mailing list, and indicated in the form of a comment within the DSDL definition.

Link to the repository containing the set of default DSDL definitions can be found on the
[contacts page](/Contact.html).
