# Libcanard

Libcanard is a minimal implementation of UAVCAN in C, suitable for deeply embedded systems and
resource constrained applications.
It is primarily targeted for low-end microcontrollers, starting from 8 KB ROM and 6 KB RAM.

At the moment, Libcanard is under development and doesn't have much documentation.
Please visit the [Github page](https://github.com/UAVCAN/libcanard) for more info,
and check back later to see the documentation and tutorials.
