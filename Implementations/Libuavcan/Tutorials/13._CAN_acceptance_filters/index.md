# CAN acceptance filters

One of the most significant features of a CAN protocol controller is the acceptance filtering capability. Most of CAN 
implementations provide some hardware acceptance filters to relieve the microcontroller from the task of filtering 
those messages which are needed from those which are not of interest.

You can read more about CAN hardware acceptance filters in [this article](http://www.inp.nsk.su/~kozak/canbus/canimpl.pdf), page 25-28.

## Operation principle

Diagram below shows how the hardware acceptance filters work within CAN protocol:

## Example

### Publisher/Client node

This file will only constantly send the messages and service requests to subscriber-server node. It will help
to better understand how the Hardware Acceptance Filters work and how to properly setup them using UAVCAN library.  
Put the following code into `publisher_client.cpp`:

```c++
{% include_relative publisher_client.cpp %}
```

### Subscriber/Server node

This file describes how to configure hardware acceptance filters within the UAVCAN.  
Put the following code into `subscriber_server.cpp`:

```c++
{% include_relative subscriber_server.cpp %}
```

## Running on Linux

Build the applications using the following CMake script:

```cmake
{% include_relative CMakeLists.txt %}
```
